**Disclaimer: The author of this code/analysis assumes for those who risk their money trying this strategy. There is inherent risk to participating in the stock market despite this technical analysis. As a general rule, one should only trade/invest with money that one can afford to lose.**


**Premise: Average down on blue chip stocks and compare with the hold strategy. Code is meant to answer the following questions.**

1. When should we average down?
2. How much should we purchase at each level?

**Averaging down / selling a portion if/when the stock rises to break even in this method has the following advantages:**

1. Provides protection against larger decline.
2. Takes advantage of natural market volatility.
3. Since we are selling shares in a first-in-first-out manner, we will frequently be selling loser stocks for a loss and keeping the ones at a lower cost basis which has numerous tax benefits.
Risks:

This strategy is based on the assumption that blue-chip stocks will not continuously decline without ever popping up. Generally speaking, stocks will drop but may also increase in value briefly as traders/investers attempt to "buy-the-dip". However, there is requirement guaranteeing this will happen: just what tends to happen to stocks in the market.
